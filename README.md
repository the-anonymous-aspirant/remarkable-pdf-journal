# remarkable_pdf_journal
I move around quite a bit in my journals, so I created a journal with the goal of making navigation via hyperlinks easier.

The html should adapt to the current year, so it can be used to produce a usable pdf whenever desired.

## Usage
Download the current_calendar_year.html (or next_calendar_year.html for next years calendar)

Open it in your web browser.

Save as a pdf and upload it to your remarkable or e-ink device.

Or modify the html yourself to make into _your_ calendar :)
